# dotfiles

I manage the various configuration files in this repo using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).  This allows me to set up symlinks for all of my dotfiles using a single command:

```
stow .
```

## Inspiration

The inspiration for this configuration comes from the [dotfiles by daviwil](https://github.com/daviwil/dotfiles) and [dotfiles by dreamsofcode-io](https://github.com/dreamsofcode-io/dotfiles).
